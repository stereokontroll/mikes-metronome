<b>Meet Mike's Metronome: Built by a drummer, designed for everyone.</b>
<br><br>
I originally built this app to help my son practice for his trumpet exams. Most metronomes were either too simple or cluttered with annoying ads. So, I decided to build one myself: clean, precise, and genuinely free.
<br><br>
Whether you are a beginner learning your first beat or a pro practicing complex time signature changes, Mike's Metronome has you covered.
<br><br>
